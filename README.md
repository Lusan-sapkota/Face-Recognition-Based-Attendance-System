## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lusansapkota/Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System.git
cd Face-Recognition-Based-Attendance-System
```

### 2. Backend Setup

#### Navigate to backend directory

```bash
cd backend
```

#### Create virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Set environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
```

> ⚠️ **Security Warning**: Never commit `.env` files or sensitive keys to version control. Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file!

#### Run the backend server

```bash
python app.py
```

The backend will start on `http://localhost:5000`

### 3. Frontend Setup

#### Navigate to frontend directory (in a new terminal)

```bash
cd frontend
```

#### Install frontend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Run the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on `http://localhost:5173`

## 📱 Usage

### 🔑 Default Login Credentials

#### Admin Access

- **Password**: `admin123` (or as set in .env file - backend (do not expose in frontend))

#### User Access

- Users need to be registered by admin first
- Login with username/password provided during registration

### 🎯 Getting Started

1. **Access the application** at `http://localhost:5173`
2. **Login as admin** using the default password
3. **Register users** through the admin dashboard
4. **Capture face data** for each user for recognition
5. **Start taking attendance** using the face recognition system

### 📸 Face Recognition Setup

1. **Register User**: Admin creates user account with basic details (supported user types are student, staff, teacher)
2. **Capture Faces**: System captures multiple face images for training
3. **Model Training**: AI model trains automatically after face capture
4. **Recognition Ready**: Users can now mark attendance using face recognition
